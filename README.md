## üöÄ**Crowdfunding Data Analysis & Contact Information Processing**

Welcome to the Crowdfunding Data Analysis repository! This project demonstrates how to process and clean contact data from an Excel file (crowdfunding.xlsx) into a structured CSV format while also providing an analysis of crowdfunding campaign statistics.

By extracting key details like contact IDs, names, and emails, I transform raw data into a well-organized format, ensuring it‚Äôs ready for database import or further use. Additionally, the project involves the creation of a Crowdfunding Database, including designing a table schema and analyzing crowdfunding campaign statistics.

üí°**What's Included:**
- Two ERD Files: Diagrams showcasing the structure and relationships within the database.

- Database Backup: A full backup of the database created during this process.

- Screenshots Folder: A collection of print screens showing the tables in the database for easy reference.
