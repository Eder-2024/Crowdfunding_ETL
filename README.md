🛠️ Contact Information Processing & Database Backup

🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the Contact Information Processing repository! This project demonstrates how to process and clean contact data from an Excel file (crowdfunding.xlsx) into a structured CSV format. 🚀

By extracting key details like contact IDs, names, and emails, we transform the raw data into a well-organized and usable format. This ensures that the data is ready for import into databases or other applications. It’s efficient, automated, and ready for real-world use! 🔥

💡 What's Included:
Two ERD Files: These diagrams showcase the structure and relationships within the database.

Database Backup: A full backup of the database created during this process.

Screenshots Folder: A collection of print screens showing the tables in the database for easy reference.

🔧 Conclusion
This repository provides an efficient solution for processing and cleaning contact data from the crowdfunding.xlsx file. By extracting and organizing important fields like contact IDs, first and last names, and emails, we prepare the data for further use or integration into a database system.

Additionally, the repository contains everything you need to understand the database structure, including ERD files, a backup of the database, and visual references of the tables.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this setup for your own data processing needs! Happy coding! ✨
