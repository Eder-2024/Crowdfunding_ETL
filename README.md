Screenshots Folder: A collection of print screens showing the tables in the database for easy reference.

🔧 Conclusion
This repository offers a streamlined solution for processing and cleaning contact data. By transforming unstructured JSON data into a well-organized CSV, the system is set up for easy import into databases or other applications. Additionally, you’ll find everything necessary to understand and replicate the database, including ERD files, a database backup, and visual references of the tables.
